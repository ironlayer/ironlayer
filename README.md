# IronLayer

**AI-native transformation control plane for Databricks.**

IronLayer sits between your SQL models and your Databricks warehouse. It generates deterministic execution plans from git diffs, manages incremental state, and layers AI advisory analysis on top -- cost predictions, risk scoring, and optimization suggestions.

## Quick Install

```bash
pip install ironlayer
```

That's it. The `ironlayer` package pulls in `ironlayer-core` automatically.

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Initialize a new IronLayer project
ironlayer init my-project

# List all discovered models
ironlayer models ./my-project

# Generate a deterministic execution plan from a git diff
ironlayer plan ./my-project HEAD~1 HEAD

# Execute the plan
ironlayer apply plan.json --repo ./my-project --auto-approve

# Trace upstream and downstream lineage
ironlayer lineage ./my-project --model staging.orders
```

### CI/CD Integration

Add IronLayer to your GitHub Actions workflow to get automatic plan comments on pull requests:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ironlayer.yml
name: IronLayer Plan
on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - "models/**"

jobs:
  plan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: ironlayer/ironlayer/.github/actions/ironlayer-plan@main
        with:
          repo-path: "."
          # Optional: connect to IronLayer Cloud for AI-powered analysis
          # api-token: ${{ secrets.IRONLAYER_API_TOKEN }}
```

### Connect to IronLayer Cloud (Optional)

Get AI-powered cost estimates, risk scoring, and SQL optimization:

```bash
ironlayer login
```

## Developer Quickstart

For local development:

```bash
# Install all workspace packages in development mode
uv sync --all-packages

# Start local dev server (SQLite + DuckDB, no external dependencies)
ironlayer dev

# Generate an execution plan from a git diff
ironlayer plan . HEAD~1 HEAD

# Execute the plan
ironlayer apply plan.json --repo . --auto-approve
```

For the full platform stack (API + AI engine + frontend + PostgreSQL):

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

See [docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md) for the full guide.

## Architecture

IronLayer is a dual-engine system:

```
                   +--------------+     +--------------+
                   |   CLI (Typer)|     | Frontend (React)
                   +--------------+     +--------------+
                         |                    |
              +----------+--------------------+
              |                               |
    +---------+---------+          +----------+---------+
    | Layer A (Core)    |          | Layer B (AI)       |
    | Deterministic     |          | Advisory           |
    | - Git diff        |          | - Cost predictor   |
    | - DAG builder     |          | - Risk scorer      |
    | - Interval planner|          | - SQL optimizer    |
    | - SQL executor    |          | - LLM client       |
    +---------+---------+          +----------+---------+
              |                               |
    +---------+---------+          +----------+---------+
    | PostgreSQL        |          | FastAPI API        |
    | (state store)     |          | (control plane)    |
    +-------------------+          +--------------------+
```

**Layer A** (core_engine) is purely deterministic: same inputs always produce identical plan JSON. No timestamps, sorted keys, content-based IDs.

**Layer B** (ai_engine) provides advisory-only intelligence. AI never mutates plans -- it annotates with cost predictions, risk scores, and optimization suggestions. Customers bring their own LLM API key (per-tenant, encrypted at rest).

## Features

- **Deterministic planning** -- Git diff to execution plan with zero ambiguity
- **Incremental state** -- Watermark tracking for time-range partitions
- **Multi-tenant** -- Row-level security, per-tenant isolation from day 1
- **AI advisory** -- Cost prediction, risk scoring, SQL optimization (non-mutating)
- **Auth & billing** -- Email/password signup, JWT tokens, Stripe subscriptions
- **Per-tenant LLM keys** -- Customers bring their own Anthropic key, encrypted at rest
- **Onboarding wizard** -- Databricks connection, plan selection, environment setup
- **Migration tools** -- Import from dbt, SQLMesh, or raw SQL
- **Local development** -- Full stack on SQLite + DuckDB, no Docker required
- **Structured telemetry** -- PII-scrubbed, per-run compute metrics
- **Audit trail** -- Hash-chained, tamper-evident audit log
